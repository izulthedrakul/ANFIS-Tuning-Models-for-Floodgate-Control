The programs included on this page focus on the design of the FIS.

1) FLC Python (1-4) 

this folder consists of all the programs that can be run with Python's skfuzzy

2) FLC Matlab (1-16) 

this folder widens the fuzzy parameters by choosing types, shapes, and models 

3) FLC results (1-16) 

this folder shows the decision-making outputs from each model

4) ANFIS data train

this folder focuses on the preprocessing algorithm using velocity output

5) ANFIS Matlab (17-28)

this folder includes both time-series gate positional changes and Manning's velocity prediction for the ANFIS algorithm

6) ANFIS results (17-28)

this folder shows the results from the ANFIS-tuned FLC and predefined ANFIS control

Note: all the programs need the prerequisite csv file to run. The "Drainage system CFD" page explains the improvement of the water parameter within each model
